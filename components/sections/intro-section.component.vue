    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Adrian Arenal, a Software Engineer from Pola de Siero (Asturias,
      Spain).
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favourite things about web development is to animate the
      interface, making it alive, joyfull or even funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is not a easy task. Animations must deal with another
      aspects like UX / UI design!
    </p>
    <p>
      This website was created not only to tell my life but also as an own
      playground with freedom in what I create.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the ones who have curiosity about the technologies involved in this
      project, you can visit the repository where I develop this website. Is an
      open-source project so feel free to see the code or even propose
      improvements!
