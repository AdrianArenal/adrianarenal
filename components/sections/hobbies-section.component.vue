    <h2>Hobbies and Sports career</h2>
    <p>
      Although I spent bunch of hours programming, I'm a very sporty person.
      Also, I love travelling and record wonderful landscapes with my drone. I'm
      very into Martial arts too, in my free time I like watching UFC(or
      whatever) combats.
    </p>

      Regarding my sports career, I had a great success doing karate when I was
      young. I started competing as a child and I achieved winning not only
      regional but also national trophies. Due to injuries and studies, I had to
      stop doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, I started playing soccer. It was a great year and I had
      fantastic memories with my teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next 2 years I gave it a try to Kick Boxing & Full Contact. But the
      injuries came back again, and I had to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next step was to join the indoor football team of the city. I made a
      lot of friends there (and also, many goals). The last year I was there, I
      was the captain, and also the trainer of the cadet team (which won the
      regional championship). What proud I was for them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm doing boxing. I hope my injuries give me a break and let me
      enjoy this beautiful sport!
