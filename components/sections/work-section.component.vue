        Starting as an internship, I developed the
        <a href="https://www.empathy.co/" target="_blank"

        After that, I joined the honorable 'Play' team.

        When joining motive, my first concern was to create the basic
        architecture of their
        <a href="https://www.motive.co/" target="_blank"
          >corporative website.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I worked with wonderful teammates on the Motive Playboard,
        where I could share knowledge from my previous work and learn a lot from
        great professionals.

        At some point, the team was growing so fast, so due to that, we did some
        organization adjustments, and a team had to have a "Manager" figure to
        take care not only on technical but also on human concerns within the
        team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was so glad on being selected for this position ðŸ¥³. Since that day, my
        main goal is to maintain a healthy environment working, guide my
        teammates to grow as professionals, and of course, enjoy this experience
        and give my best everyday!
